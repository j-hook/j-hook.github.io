### Predicting the Potability of Water

This is the first part of an exploratory data analysis project examining characteristics of about 3000 water samples in relation to potability. I obtained this data project as part of the beta testing of the <a href="https://www.lonelyoctopus.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lonely Octopus</a>. It comprises 9 primary water sampling characteristics and a binary outcome indicating the sample was potable or not. In the first stage of this project, I focused utilizing loops in python to visualize the data. You can preview the results <a href="water-quality-project.html" target="_blank"><b>here</b></a> and find the Jupyter Notebook syntax on <a href="https://github.com/j-hook/Side-Projects/tree/main/Water%20Quality%20EDA" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><b>GitHub</b></a>.
