This is the first stage of a project exploring my reading activity from Goodreads. For the initial part of the project, I obtained three raw data from Goodreads:

* A CSV file of all of my books on my Goodreads shelves
* A JSON object of the activity posted to my Goodreads feed
* A JSON object of my book reviews

I utilized Python to read the data files and create a database in MySQL. You can find the Jupyter Notebook for the data upload <a href="https://github.com/j-hook/Side-Projects/tree/main/my_goodreads_data" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><b>here</b></a>. Next steps are to clean and process the data for exploratory analysis and visualizing. 


A snapshot of some of the syntax for creating a table in the database using Python.

```{python, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE }
# create the activities table
try:
    conn = mysql.connect(host='', database = 'goodreads', user = '', password = '')
    if conn.is_connected():
        cursor = conn.cursor()
        cursor.execute("select database();")
        record = cursor.fetchone()
        print("You're connect to the database:", record)
        cursor.execute('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS activities;')
        print('Creating table...')
# create the new table
        cursor.execute('''
            CREATE TABLE activities(
                           activity_id int primary key not null,
                           activity_type varchar(255),
                           activity_desc varchar(255),
                           product varchar(255),
                           created_date varchar(255) 
                           )''')
        print('activities table is created')
# parse the json data
    for i, item in enumerate(activities_list):
        activity_id = i
        activity_type = item.get('activity_type')
        activity_desc = item.get('activity')
        product = item.get('product')
        created_date = item.get('created_at')
    # pull the data into the database    
        cursor.execute(
                '''
                INSERT INTO goodreads.activities (
                activity_id,
                activity_type,
                activity_desc,
                product,
                created_date 
                )
                VALUES (%s,%s,%s,%s,%s)
                ''', 
                (
                activity_id,
                activity_type,
                activity_desc,
                product,
                created_date,
              )                
            )
        print("record inserted")
    conn.commit()
except Error as e:
    print("Error while connecting to MySQL", e)       
```
