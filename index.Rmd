# Bio

I am a postdoctoral researcher with a passion for data analytics, statistics, and research methodology. 

I currently work at the <a href="https://med.fsu.edu/autisminstitute/home" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Autism Institute</a> in the <a href="https://www.fsu.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">FSU</a> College of Medicine. Here, I am a research and data scientist that leads the data analysis on multiple federal grant projects, helps design the methodology for new projects, streamlines the collection of data, and refines the data organization.

My research focuses on the screening and assessment of children with early communication days and signs of autism, but my professional goal is use data analytics to drive informed decision-making for improving healthcare.
